#DESCRIPTION

(In this project, sentiment analysis is performed on a dataset of customer reviews to classify them as positive or negative. The approach involves two main components: TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.

ðŸ“Œ Data Processing & Vectorization
The dataset consists of customer reviews labeled with sentiment (1 for positive, 0 for negative). The text data is first cleaned and prepared, then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This method quantifies how important a word is in a document relative to the entire dataset, helping reduce the impact of commonly occurring but less meaningful words.

ðŸ¤– Model Training
Once vectorized, the data is split into training and testing sets. A Logistic Regression model is trained on the TF-IDF vectors of the training data. Logistic Regression is a linear model widely used for binary classification due to its simplicity and interpretability.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation
After training, the model is tested on the unseen test data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess performance. A confusion matrix provides insight into true positives, false positives, and other prediction outcomes.

âœ… Results
The model successfully learns patterns in the reviews and achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments. The combination of TF-IDF and Logistic Regression proves to be effective for text classification tasks with binary outcomes.)
